# Buffelgrass Tracker

This is the angular webpage for the buffelgrass tracking project. You can view it at buffelgrass.usanpn.org.
The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.3.

# Requirements

This project makes use of the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). if you don't have it installed already, run `npm install -g @angular/cli`. If it's not installed you will get errors like: `ng: command not found` when trying to run or build.

## Local Development

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build --base-href=/buffelgrass-tracker/ --prod` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory which then just needs to be copied to /var/www/data on dev or ops.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
